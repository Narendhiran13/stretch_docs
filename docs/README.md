We provide ROS-related code for the Stretch RE1 mobile manipulator through the [*stretch_ros* repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros). The repository includes a ROS node that provides an interface to the robot, calibration code, and demonstrations of various robot capabilities.
